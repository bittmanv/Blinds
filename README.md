# Blinds
Project covering automated automated blinds with Openhab

Published based on request on Openhab discussion forums

espRoller32 Arduino based sketch 

ShadeEsp32Mini  Kicad project for PCB With MH Mini ESP32 Board 

ShadeEsp32V2 Kicad project for PCB Based on ESP32 Wroom module 

PCBs I have made with my laser engraver with black masked , precision and allign was little bit limiting 

# High level summary

  We have 2 double windows in our kithen/living room. I have bought 2 sun stop blinds and I implemented as part of my home automation to enable privacy on windows coming from street and escpecially on window from south to limit sun which was lights directly to peoples sitting face to window. During summer I use them as aditional temperature and light for room. 
  
  Whole scheduling is based on openhab rules. 

 # Material summary
 JGA25-12V chinese motors with encoder, appox 25rpm  is fine 

 DRV8872  H-Bridge (for each motor) 
 
 Mini360  Buck step down module 
 
 AMS 1117-3.3V regulator 
 
 Some SMD and THT Passive parts according to schematic

 Optionally 
 
 Omron G2MB 5V SSR Relay - we have small 220V led bulb as over window, which is also controlled by automation
